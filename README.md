- [X] use a headless browser
- [ ] rotate my ip address
- [ ] automatically solve captchas

## Requirements

python >= 3.9

To run the project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

**Setting Up the Environment**

* Windows: `./setup_Windows.bat`
* Linux/macOS: `./setup_Linux.sh`

These scripts will install required dependencies, and build a virtual environment for you if you don't have one.

## Usage

To run the program, you need to run the following command:

### Note

The program still needs to be improved, some times it doesn't work as expected, because the website is constantly changing and the CAPTCHAs are not always the same.
